# two_stage_distributionally_robust_copositive_cone
This is the code for one chapter of my master degree thesis. Basically, I want to design a network with two-stage location-inventory model, modifed by distribuitonally robust techniques. Copositive Cone (CP) programming is involved, and sime-definite matrix approximation is incorporated to deal the CP problem.
